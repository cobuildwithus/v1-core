# Core Beliefs

1. Agent legibility is a repository-level requirement.
2. Keep `AGENTS.md` concise; store durable detail in indexed docs.
3. Architecture constraints only scale when enforced mechanically in scripts/CI.
4. Plans, architecture docs, and debt tracking should stay versioned and local.
5. For protocol work, correctness and invariant preservation outrank style preferences.
