# Archived Execution Plans

Historical execution plans that are no longer active belong here.

- Keep files immutable snapshots of prior planning context.
- Do not move archived plans back into `active/`; create a new active plan for new work.
- `active/` should contain only in-flight plans plus `COORDINATION_LEDGER.md`.
