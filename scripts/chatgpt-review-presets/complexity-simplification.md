Objective:
Find behavior-preserving simplifications that reduce complexity, risk, and maintenance cost.

Review priorities:
- Dead code, no-op abstractions, duplicated logic.
- Overly nested control flow that can be flattened with early returns.
- State that can be derived instead of stored.
- Redundant parameters, wrappers, or internal helper chains.
- Naming/type clarity improvements that reduce future misuse.
