Objective:
Assess economic security and incentive compatibility of the protocol design and implementation.

Review priorities:

- Incentives that can be gamed for extraction without adding value.
- Mispriced rewards/penalties that enable farming or strategic abuse.
- Timing windows that let rational actors capture outsized upside.
- Oracle/dispute/deadline assumptions that can be manipulated economically.
- Treasury/stream/settlement mechanics that can leak value under adversarial behavior.

We want to build a system where honesty pays, a market that elicits the information we need to help us accomplish our goals, and avoids any downsides/bad side effects/incentives as best as we can.
